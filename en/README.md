# OPEN STUDENT BOOK

Hello World!!! I'm Edoardo Viola and I'm a Mozilla Volunteer. From August 2016, I have been working on this little guide to introduce Open Projects and Open Source to students of all faculties in Italian universities. It's important to show them the potential of working in an open community and to demonstrate why doing so is important, not just for the individual but for humanity as a whole.

This project can also serve as a good starting place for those who are interested in learning how to work collaboratively, mixing our passions and skills to build an open project. Feel free to make any suggestions about the project's goals here; our method of working is meant to be inclusive to everyone.
