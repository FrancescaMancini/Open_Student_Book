# HUMANISTIC SCIENCE STUDIES

The teaching program of the humanities studies department is extensive and articulated;
the humanities study primarily man and the human condition using the analytical and critical type of instruments.
These instruments are different from empiricism, typical of science. For this the scope of humanities studies are the
humanities such as languages and classical literature and, more generally, literature, philosophy,
history ( divided into historical and geogrphical context, historical and artistic historical and literary) and then law, arts,
archeology, antropology. Next to these classical disciplines there are modern, connected to the rapid evolution of media.

 The humanities are divided into classical and scientific:
- In classical have letters, languages, philosophy and cultural heritage;
- In scientific have sciences of communication, sciences and psychological techniques, sciences of education and 
 formation.
  
## Classical Studies
The course of letters have objective to acquire a basic knowledge of historical and geographical, linguistic and literary
and to develop abilities connected to the reading of texts and documents in their original language, mester the italian in oral
and written form. The course of studies in Languages provides the formation of professional figure able to decline the 
communication in different forms and ways through the theoretical and practical study of Italian language and foreign languages.
The course in Philosophy gives knowledge of the history of philosophy, morality, politics, logic, aesthetics, etc.. A graduate in Cultural Heritage has historical,artistic,archaeological and archival skills and has acquired skills in the ideation sectors of cultural events, organization and promotion of shows and possesses all the methodological and critical instruments for reading the expressive languages.

## Scientific Studies
A course in Communication Sciences has objective to develop a methodological preparation, technique and theory on communication problems, developing skills and abilities in the acquisition, treatment and organization of databases, linked to the different sensory modalities and to realise communication campaigns using all levels of human interpretation. The course in Psychological Sciences and Techniques has the purpose to make acquire a deep knowledge, systematic and updated of the differents sectors concerning the knowledge of psychological processes, biopsychological, cognitive, emotional and social, moreover, offer the psycological and scientifics methods and processes concerning the Human behavioural. The Educational Science course is focues to acquire a solid cultural preparation who helps the students to have theorical and methods skills. These last skills are necessary for the teaching activities who works in the formative system. 

## Factors which are common the Collaborative planning (open source)

### Classical Studies
A Classic Humanist could have some interest in the openSource and in the Open Project, the linguist could be interest an a experience in the localization and translation in tecnics or in different contests. The philosopher (how the Psycologist) could be interest to publish theories with an community help. Moreover, could be interested to internazionalize these theroies and cooperate with communicator and linguist. A student of letters could be interested to make and revise texts and articles in differents areas how scientific and technical. For the Cultural Heritage students could be interests to develop innovative guide for museums e could make with engineer and computer scientist.

#### Food for thought
* Improve the skills in localization en translation in multidisciplinary projects
* Improve the text and articles inspect
* New theorem and theories development with a community support
* Multidisciplinary project development
* Innovative Arts project development

### Scientific Studies
Un Umanista orientato alle scienze può avere vari interessi nei confronti dell'Open Source e della progettazione collaborativa, chi studia scienze delle comunicazioni potrebbe essere interessato a un'esperienza di preparazione di campagne informativa e comunicative circa la promozione degli obiettivi della stessa community o del progetto, oppure, offrire supporto su aspetti tecnici pratici di supporto alle community, gli studenti di scienze e tecniche psicologiche possono esser interessati allo sviluppo di teoremi e teorie e confrontarsi liberamente con altre persone che supportano liberamente le loro ipotesi e altresì potrebbero collaborare a progetti multidisciplinari applicando metodologie pratiche legati alla psicometria e alle indagini delle masse. Uno studente di sciende dell'educazione e della formazione potrebbe esser interessato sia ad applicare praticamente nozioni teoriche sviluppate durante il corso di studi applicando e realizzando nuove attività formative in collaborazione con altri professionisti o studenti di altri percorsi universitari, oppure creando nuovi e innovativi strumenti per la didattica. 

#### Food for thought
* Realizzazione di Campagne informative e comunicative
* Migliorare le proprie abilità di supporto alla comunicazione
* Sviluppo di nuove teorie psicologiche
* Applicazione di teorie di indagine psicologica
* Realizzazione di attività educative
* Collaborare alla realizzazione di strumenti innovativi per la didattiva
* Migliorare le proprie abilità applicando le teorie di educazione
