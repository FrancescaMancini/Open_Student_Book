# Scientific Studies

Scientific studies consist of 3 different areas: Technology and Design, Health-oriented and the so-called Classic Sciences.

The main fields of the Technology and Design area are Engineering and Computer Science, whereas Medicine, Biology and
Pharmacology are found in the Health-oriented area. Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and others are listed amongst the Classic
Sciences.

The common denominator that connects these 3 areas is a "knowledge database" built with organised research activity,
systematic and rigorous methods, in order to describe reality and the laws the govern the occurrence of phenomena in a 
plausible and objective way.
